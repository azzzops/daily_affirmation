The Daily Affirmations App is a simple web project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It displays random positive affirmations to help users stay motivated, confident, and focused throughout the day.

Each time the user clicks the “Show Affirmations” button, a new uplifting message appears — reinforcing positive self-talk and mental well-being.



##Problem Being Solved##

Many people struggle with negative thoughts and low self-esteem, especially during stressful days.
This project aims to promote positivity and mindfulness through daily affirmations — short, empowering statements that help users:

Build self-confidence

Maintain motivation

Develop emotional resilience


##How It Works##

A collection of affirmations is stored inside an array in script.js.

When the user clicks the Show Affirmations button,

JavaScript randomly selects one affirmation from the array.

The affirmation is displayed dynamically in the browser.

Each affirmation is styled clearly for easy reading and emotional impact.
